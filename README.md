## Objective:

  - Implement basic hover effects for buttons and interactive elements.
  - Ensure all interactive elements provide visual feedback (as per the design).

- **Code Quality**:

  - Follow clean, readable, and maintainable coding practices.
  - Use BEM methodology for class naming.

  - Ensure the page is displayed correctly in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
